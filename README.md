# Soulbound Wrapper

**Soulbound** is a free-to-play, retro action RPG where you explore a pixel-art world, battle monsters and tackle quests. It's playable directly at [play.soulbound.game](https://play.soulbound.game/).

This wrapper simply launches the web version in a fullscreen window so it feels like a native desktop app.

## Getting started

1. Download the latest build from the **Releases** page.
2. Run the executable to launch the game.

## Features

* **Fullscreen on launch**: The game opens in true fullscreen mode.
* **F11 toggles fullscreen**: Quickly switch between fullscreen and windowed mode.
* **Press and hold `Esc`**: Hold the Escape key to open the quit confirmation dialog.
