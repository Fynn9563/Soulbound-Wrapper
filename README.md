# Soulbound Wrapper

**Soulbound** is a free-to-play, retro action RPG where you explore a pixel-art world, battle monsters and tackle quests. It's playable directly at [play.soulbound.game](https://play.soulbound.game/).

This wrapper simply launches the web version in a fullscreen window so it feels like a native desktop app.

## Getting started
